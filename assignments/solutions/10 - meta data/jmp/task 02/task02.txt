a) Yes, because analog media is describable the same as other media. In this case, MPEG-7 would be used to describe analog media that
   is located anywhere (e.g. over the internet).

b) MPEG-7 uses the BiM Code to compress its data that allows to compress the data on average 98%. The which compression is
   better can't be answered directly, because the MPEG-4 format supports many different codecs with different compression levels.

c) - For now there is too few progress in the development of software that supports automatic creation  MPEG-7 descriptions.
   - Software programs does not support all capabilities of MPEG-7
   - Too much overhead. (High level descriptors have to be created by humans manually).
