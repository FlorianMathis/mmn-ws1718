a) user generated data, rich internet applications, web browser as application platform

b) Pro:
        - In those days modern web applications and mobile apps are preferred to normal desktop applications

        - E.g. facebook, google (Google Docs), youtube, wordpress allow the users to create their own content without
          the need of programming skills

        - In general the popularity of facebook shows that Web 2.0 is state of the art because the users want one platform
          with centralized information that meet their interests.

   Contra:
        - Using internet platforms mobile and desktop won't be enough to to interact with digital elements. I think in the
          future Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality will have a greater role to play.

        - Actually we don't know if people use smartphones, wearables and apps as much as they do in those days.
          Perhaps in the future people will use the web less than today.

        - Later, Artificial Intelligence could replace the user generated data completely and could change the way how the web
          makes progress.
