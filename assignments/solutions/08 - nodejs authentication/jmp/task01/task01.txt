Screen scraping is the process of getting information by parsing html code from another website. It is used e.g.
by flight booking portals, price comparision portals to get information from other pages. Screen scraping is used
as the last option if no API does exist, because using an API is much easier: Parsing HTML code is not so easy because
each website does have another HTML structure that needs to be parsed differently. Another problem is that the HTML
structure of the scraped pages could change and then the scraping algorithm does not work anymore.
Screen Scraping can be prohibited by the web page's owner because it's intellectual property. Before doing screen scraping
the websites must be checked if you may do it.
